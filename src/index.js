import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import App from "./App.js";
ReactDOM.render(
    <App />,
    document.getElementById("root")
);


// ReactDOM.render is the function that tells React what to render and where to render it — In this case, we’re rendering a component called App (which we’ll create soon), and it’s being rendered at the DOM element with the ID root.
